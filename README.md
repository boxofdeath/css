Welcome to my Counter-Strike Source repo. Here I have my Autoexec.cfg file and powershell script that updates sprays on a rotation.

Place the script in the directory with all of your .vtf files. The script will enumrate all of them and cycle through. Even after a restart!

To generate .vtf files from your image collection head over to https://sprays.lightwo.net/ or setup your own repo of it from github: https://github.com/Mishcatt/VTF-Editor
